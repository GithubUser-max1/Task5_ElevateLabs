### Cyber Security Internship - Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark
## Overview
This repository contains the deliverables for Task 5 of the Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship. The objective of this task was to gain hands-on experience with network packet capture and analysis using Wireshark, identifying basic protocols and traffic types.
## Task Objective
The primary goals for this task were:
 * To capture live network packets.
 * To identify basic protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP) and traffic types within the captured data.
## Tools Used
 * Wireshark: A free and open-source packet analyzer used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.
Deliverables
 * network_capture.pcap: The packet capture file obtained from Wireshark.
 * report.md: A short report summarizing the findings, including identified protocols and packet details.
Steps Performed
 * Wireshark Installation: Installed Wireshark on my local machine.
 * Interface Selection: Launched Wireshark and selected the active network interface for capturing.
 * Traffic Generation: Initiated a packet capture and then generated network traffic by Browse several websites (e.g., Google, Example.com) and performing ping commands to a server.
 * Capture Termination: Stopped the capture after approximately one minute to collect a sufficient amount of data.
 * Protocol Filtering and Identification: Applied various display filters in Wireshark (e.g., http, dns, tcp, icmp) to identify at least three different protocols present in the captured traffic.
 * Packet Analysis: Examined the details of individual packets for each identified protocol to understand their structure and content.
 * Export Capture: Exported the captured packets as a .pcap file.
 * Findings Documentation: Documented the identified protocols and key packet details in the report.md file.
Identified Protocols (Examples)
During the analysis, I successfully identified and analyzed packets related to the following protocols:
 * DNS (Domain Name System): Observed queries and responses involved in resolving domain names to IP addresses.
 * HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Captured web Browse traffic, including GET requests and server responses.
 * TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Identified fundamental TCP handshake packets (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and data transfer segments, highlighting reliable communication.
 * ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): Captured echo request and reply packets generated by ping commands.
## How to View the Capture File
To view the network_capture.pcap file:
 * Ensure you have Wireshark installed.
 * Open Wireshark.
 * Go to File > Open and select the network_capture.pcap file from this repository.

The provided images display Wireshark captures, showcasing various network protocols and their details.
## Here's a breakdown of the key elements observed:
 * ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Traffic: One screenshot shows an ARP request, where a device (192.168.120.31) is asking for the MAC address of another device (192.168.120.92). ARP is crucial for mapping IP addresses to physical MAC addresses on a local network.
 * TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Communication: Multiple screenshots highlight TCP packets.
   * Communication is seen over Destination Port 443, which is typically used for HTTPS (secure web traffic).
   * The presence of RST, ACK flags in some TCP packets indicates a connection reset or termination.
   * TCP Retransmission is frequently observed, suggesting potential network issues or congestion where packets had to be resent.
 * UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and DNS (Domain Name System) Queries: One image clearly shows a DNS query packet sent via UDP.
   * The packet originates from a local IP (192.168.120.31) and targets a public DNS server (1.1.1.1) on Destination Port 53, which is standard for DNS.
   * This indicates active domain name resolution, common during web Browse or application usage.
 * Overall Network Activity: The captures collectively demonstrate diverse network activity, including local device discovery (ARP), reliable web communication (TCP/HTTPS), and domain name lookups (UDP/DNS).


## Interview questions 
 1) What is Wireshark used for?
   Wireshark is a free and open-source network protocol analyzer used for capturing and interactively Browse the traffic running on a computer network. It's widely used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.
2) What is a packet?
   In networking, a packet is a small unit of data that is transmitted over a network. It's essentially a formatted block of data that carries network control information (like source and destination addresses) and user data.
3) How to filter packets in Wireshark?
   Packets in Wireshark can be filtered using display filters applied in the display filter bar (located at the top of the main window). You type a filter expression (e.g., http, dns, tcp, ip.addr == 192.168.1.1) and press Enter to apply it. This allows you to narrow down the displayed packets to only those matching your criteria.
4) What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
   TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are both transport layer protocols used over the Internet Protocol (IP).
   * TCP is a connection-oriented, reliable protocol. It establishes a connection before data transfer, ensures ordered delivery of data, provides error checking, and retransmits lost segments. It's used for applications where reliability is crucial, like web Browse (HTTP), email (SMTP), and file transfer (FTP).
   * UDP is a connectionless, unreliable protocol. It sends data without establishing a connection or guaranteeing delivery. It's faster and has less overhead than TCP, making it suitable for applications where speed is more important than guaranteed delivery, such as streaming video/audio, online gaming, and DNS queries.
 5)  What is a DNS query packet?
   A DNS (Domain Name System) query packet is a request sent from a client (e.g., your computer) to a DNS server to resolve a human-readable domain name (like "www.google.com") into its corresponding IP address. It's typically sent over UDP port 53.
 6)  How can packet capture help in troubleshooting?
   Packet capture can significantly help in troubleshooting network issues by providing a detailed, real-time view of network traffic. It allows you to:
   * Identify network bottlenecks or latency.
   * Detect unauthorized network activity or security breaches.
   * Diagnose application performance problems.
   * Verify correct protocol implementation and communication.
   * Pinpoint the source and destination of traffic, helping to isolate issues.
 7) What is a protocol?
   A protocol in networking is a set of rules and guidelines for communicating data. It specifies the format, timing, sequencing, and error checking for data exchange between devices on a network. Protocols enable different devices and software to understand each other and communicate effectively. Examples include TCP, UDP, IP, HTTP, and DNS.
8) Can Wireshark decrypt encrypted traffic?
   By default, Wireshark cannot decrypt encrypted traffic (e.g., HTTPS, SSH, VPN traffic) because it doesn't have access to the encryption keys. However, it can decrypt some types of encrypted traffic if you provide the necessary decryption keys or session secrets (e.g., SSL/TLS private keys, pre-shared keys for WPA/WPA2 Wi-Fi). Without these keys, the encrypted data will appear as unreadable, obfuscated packets.
